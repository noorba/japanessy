                <h1>Manga &amp; anime</h1>
               <p class="intro">Once almost completely unknown to the&nbsp;world outside Japan, manga (Japanese comics) and anime (Japanese animation) have become a global phenomenon&nbsp;- and their popularity is growing every day.</p>


<h2>Manga</h2>
<pclass="intro">Manga books are generally printed in black and white and cover a wide variety of genres and subject matter aimed at both sexes and all ages, not just for young boys - to&nbsp;whom comics are generally marketed in the West. </p>
<p class="intro">Themes include romance, action adventure, science fiction, comedy, sports and can also venture into darker subject matter for adults such as horror and more risqué material; though the latter tends not to be acknowledged in everyday life and culture.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="intro">As it makes up a large section of Japan's publishing industry, manga books can be found and seen everywhere. People reading manga on trains during rush hour is a common sight in Tokyo as well as the rest of the country. </p>
<p class="intro">Every town will have a book store with aisles upon aisles of different manga genres and larger cities even have stores entirely dedicated to the medium over multiple storeys. Convenience stores are quite happy for patrons to stand and read manga even if they are not going to buy and many waiting rooms and restaurants have bookshelves with popular serialisations. </p>
<p class="intro">Most manga aimed at children uses a simplistic style and the adorable characters feed Japan's love for all things <em>kawaii</em> (cute). Characters also have oversized eyes through which the artists are able to convey emotion more easily. Below are a few examples of the more popular manga comics amongst children:</p>

<h2>Anime</h2>
<p>Once certain manga have proven their worth by popularity, the natural progression is for an animated TV series to be created, however, manga is not the only source of inspiration for anime. For example, Pokémon was a worldwide hit as a video game for Nintendo before it was made into manga and anime series. </p>
<p>The obvious differences from manga such as colour, movement and sound bring anime to life, but there is one additional element which is extremely important: the theme song. Artists from the J-pop and J-rock world are all falling over themselves to write the theme songs for the next big anime series as it is almost a guaranteed hit and provides great exposure. The anticipation of which artist it will be can often overshadow the anime itself, being the topic of hot discussion in school playgrounds and internet forums.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>One of Japan's most famous, successful and critically acclaimed animators is Hayao Miyazaki, co-director of Studio Ghibli, which was founded in 1985. His long career has seen him create numerous original feature films in the animated form which have touched the hearts of the Japanese people as well as the rest of the world. </p>
<p>On a visual level, his animation style is very unique and cannot be mistaken, especially as his characters tend to have small eyes, going against the usual trend for larger eyes as mentioned earlier. Another distinguishing feature of his work is that most of the protagonists are strong independent girls or women.</p>
